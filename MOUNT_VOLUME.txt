Automount EBS Volume on Reboot
By default on every reboot, the  EBS volumes other than root volume will get unmounted. To enable automount, you need to make an entry in the /etc/fstab file.

Step 1: Back up the /etc/fstab file.

sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
#Step 2: Open /etc/fstab file and make an entry in the following format.
#device_name mount_point file_system_type fs_mntops fs_freq fs_passno
#For example,
/dev/xvdf       /newvolume   ext4    defaults,nofail        0       0

#Step 3: Execute the following command to check id the fstab file has any error.
 
 sudo mount -a
 
#If the above command shows no error, it means your fstab entry is good.
#Now, on every reboot, the extra EBS volumes will get mounted automatically.
